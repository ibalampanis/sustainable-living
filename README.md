# Sustainable Living: Tips and Tricks for a Greener Lifestyle

The purpose of this repository is to get familiar with Git and GitHub's concepts, and practice some basic commands. In addition, the project aims to provide a brief guide of tips and tricks for a sustainable living by the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst) of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://aueb.gr/en).

**First of all:** Send your GitHub username to [Ilias](mailto:ilbalampan@aueb.gr) (if you have not shared it already), and expect an invitation to join as a repository collaborator.

## Tasks

- Clone this repository.
- Add information about interesting things to do for a greener lifestyle to the **guide.md** file. (Create the file if it does not already exist.)
- Contribute generously and in several categories.
- In case you reuse other people's material, make sure to:
  1. rephrase the content, and
  2. add a reference to the original source.
- Introduce new categories and organize things.
- Feel free to add images and videos.
- You may modify, fix, or improve existing content added by others.
- Commit your changes.
- Push to the GitHub repository (if required, pull and resolve merge conflicts).

## Tips
- Copy-pasting text is considered plagiarism, so make sure to rephrase it.
- Configure your editor to use a spellchecker (in case you have not already done so).
- Include links where necessary (*e.g.,* locations, online courses, *etc.*).
- Rearrange text if you think it should be organized differently&mdash;refactorings are always welcome!
- You can include images and videos, but don't forget to commit and push them. Images and videos should be placed in the ```media/``` directory. (Create the directory if it does not already exist.)
- Again, use references for images and videos&mdash;you cannot reuse web content without citing the original source.
- Be creative! Take it a step further by including a file with guidelines to contributing for newcomers, and a code of conduct file.

## Grading System
- Number of contributions&mdash;the more the better!
- Completeness of each contribution (one-sentence contributions are considered "bad" contributions).
- Breaking things comes with a penalty...
- But, fixing others' breaks has a bonus!
- Quality of commit messages&mdash;they should be descriptive (of the change) and concise. Default commit messages are not welcome.
- Missing references in reused material is not welcome.
- Content should be in proper Markdown format&mdash;check the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
