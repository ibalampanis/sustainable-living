# Contributing guidelines

Hello and thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! If you haven't already done so, please read the README.md
file for more information about the tasks.

## Where should I start?

You can always go to the `guide.md` file, where you can see tips on sustainable living written by the contributors, and
add your own tips in any category you want. Even better, if you don't see a category you think it should exist, feel
free to initiate it yourself!

## Do I have to open a pull request to merge my changes?

The answer is **no**. You are a collaborator to this project, therefore you can immediately push your changes to this
repository. This also means you **don't** have to fork this repository. If you are not a collaborator, please refer to
the [README](README.md) file for more information.

## Fixing vocabulary, grammar, syntax and style

**Feel free** to correct any mistakes you see in the files! Although keep in mind that you **should not** ruin other people's
work. It is within our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ibalampanis/sustainable-living/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 
to always be respectful to each other's work and, if that's not enough, there is definitely a penalty for that!

## Be creative

Unleash your creativity! If you have an idea doing something that doesn't already exist in the repository, try it! You
never know, you might **inspire** other people too!

## Updating the guidelines

The contribution guidelines can always be improved, so don't hesitate to add sections or content missing, and fix
linguistic mistakes.

## Commit messages

Commit messages are important, so make sure to write a descriptive message (of the change) and keep it concise. If
you are not sure what to write, you can always check the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

## References

If you reuse other people's material, make sure to include references to the original source. This is especially
important if you are including images or videos, because you **cannot** reuse web content without citing the original
source.
