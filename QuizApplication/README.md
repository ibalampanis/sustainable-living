## How green are you?

Have you ever wondered whether your daily life practices are green enough or you
need to take a step back and redefine you eco-activity status?
Being oriented to a sustainable lifestyle, means that you embrace some fundamental
principles, follow & adhere to standards and finally shape accordingly and
eco-friendly behavioral pattern.
If you are not sure of your position and you want to monitor your progress,
you came to the right place!

## How it works?

Forget time-consuming and complex questionnaires, with you struggling and even
feeling unsatisfied with the whole process. We keep it **simple**, **quick**
and **direct**, posing up-to-date and to-the-point questions.
Just answer to 20 queries and receive your feedback instantly.
Designed in Java programming language, the application is a beginner-friendly
and ideal chance to get started with a simple software project.

### What to do?

1. First you will need to clone the project "sustainable-living", so you can obtain
the source code locally. We are going to do that through the terminal.
For Unix-based os open the utility application "Terminal", while for MS Windows
use a Unix-like environment, like CygWin.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibalampanis/sustainable-living.git
```

2. Change directory and move to QuizApplication. You can track your working
directory, via the `pwd` command.

```bash
cd QuizApplication
```

3. Compile and run the program

```java
javac SustainabilityQuiz.java
java SustainabilityQuiz
```

## How to contribute?

Following a welcoming and collaborative model, we consider your contribution 
important, in order to maintain and improve app's UX, and that may be done by:
- optimize / enhance the source code
- add interactivity to application, by transitioning from CLI interface to a
more user-friendly GUI (ex. Swing).
- send feedback and propose modifications on the app's software
