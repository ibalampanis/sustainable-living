# Sustainable Code Contribution
If you have a nice idea that could be implemented in code please contribute it. You can use whichever language you want to, e.g. Java, Python, C++ etc. Keep in mind that you should provide a guide on how to run the program(compilation, execution etc.) to help others run it in their own environment.

## Testing and Documentation
It's a good practice to document your code to let others know how to use it or improve it. You should also provide unit tests that ensure your code does what is intended.

## Refactoring
If you feel that part of a code can be refactored (for example, something could be a method, function or a class) do it, but keep in mind that you should speak with the original authors to not make any accidental changes that could ruin anyone's work!
