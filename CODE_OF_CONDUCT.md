# Code of Conduct

Aiming to entrench a positive environment, we need to accept and adhere to some
behavioral guidelines, while committing and engaging in the project. Embracing
a collaborative - oriented conduct model, will bring us closer to the project's
scope by developing communication and cooperation skills. 

## NEED TO

+ Treat your colleagues as you want to be treated
+ Follow the practices and standards stated on README.md


```

## AVOID
