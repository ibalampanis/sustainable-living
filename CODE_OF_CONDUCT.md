# Code of Conduct

Aiming to entrench a positive environment, we need to accept and adhere to some
behavioral guidelines, while committing and engaging in the project. Embracing
a collaborative - oriented conduct model, will bring us closer to the project's
scope by developing communication and cooperation skills.

## SCOPE

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces of the project, including the
repository, the wiki, the blog, the social media pages, and any other
communication channel that the project might have. The project's scope is
defined by the project's aims and goals, and by the tasks that are being
followed.

## GOAL

The Code of Conduct is meant to be a living document, that will be updated
periodically, in order to cover any changes that might occur in the project's
environment. The goal is to create a healthy and inclusive environment, where
everyone can contribute to the project's success.

## RESPONSIBILITY

The project's maintainers are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct,
and for clarifying any doubts or questions that might arise. The maintainers
are also responsible for updating the Code of Conduct, in order to keep it
relevant and up - to - date.
