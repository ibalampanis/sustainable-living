# Sustainable Living: Tips and Tricks for a Greener Lifestyle

## Getting started with sustainable & green living

Defining environmental sustainability in a clear and intelligible way, is of paramount importance, in order to approach
this topic properly.
Following a green lifestyle, means to shape a way of life oriented to some earth-friendly key directions, stated below.

- Redefine your needs and develop lighter habits
- Protect natural resources by avoiding their overconsumption and safeguarding biodiversity
- Be actively aware of the current threats posed to environment (i.e. climate crisis components) and get eco-conscious
- Become more adaptive and open to eco-friendly practices

## There are many things you can do to live a greener lifestyle. Here are some ideas to get you started:

### Reduce your energy consumption

One of the most effective ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to use less energy. You can do this by turning off
lights and electronics when you're not using them, using energy-efficient appliances, and sealing air leaks in your
home.

### Reduce your washing

- ***"Waste Not Every day" by Erin Rhoads***, published by **Hardie Grant Books** and priced at £10, the biggest impact
  on the
  environment caused by fashion occurs after we bring clothing home. In fact, 82% of the energy a garment consumes is a
  result of the washing and drying we do every week. **Rhoads** proposes alternatives to traditional washing, such as
  spot-cleaning and using diluted vodka or lemon juice to eliminate odors.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Clean with castile

- In "Clean Green" by **Jen Chillingsworth**, published by **Quadrille** and priced at £7.55, it is suggested that
  making your
  own cleaning products, such as polish and detergent, can decrease the amount of plastic entering your home and
  minimize the release of harmful VOCs, including formaldehyde. **Chillingsworth** highly recommends liquid castile
  soap,
  which was traditionally made with pure olive oil from Spain, but is now commonly produced by blending vegetable oils
  like hemp, avocado, jojoba, and coconut. For a straightforward and versatile kitchen spray, combine 50ml of castile
  soap with 800ml of tap water in a spray bottle, and add a few drops of essential oils, such as tea tree oil, which has
  antibacterial properties. Finally, spray the solution and wipe it down with a clean cloth.<sup>2</sup>

### Go for plastic-free personal care

- According to **Chillingsworth**, there are numerous options to explore when it comes to waste-free sanitary
  protection,
  and she recommends purchasing a reusable tampon applicator. This applicator is reusable, fits any size of tampon, and
  is antimicrobial and simple to insert. Once used, it can be wiped, rinsed, and returned to its storage box, which
  conveniently fits in a purse. It should be sterilized in hot water between periods for hygiene purposes.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Recycle as much as you can

- **Helen Bird**, a plastics expert at Wrap, a government waste advisory organization, states that many major
  supermarkets
  offer in-store collection points for stretchy plastics such as carrier bags, bread bags, and frozen food bags, which
  cannot typically be recycled at home.<sup>2</sup>


- **TerraCycle** is a company that specializes in rescuing waste that is difficult to recycle and is not handled by
  local
  councils. They offer national recycling programs free of charge, as well as sell zero-waste boxes that allow you to
  gather and return most non-organic, non-recyclable, and non-hazardous waste for recycling purposes. You can visit
  their website to locate a program in your area or establish your own.<sup>2</sup>

### Look after your electrical appliances

- The Restart Project is a social enterprise that strives to improve our relationship with electronics and electrical
  items. According to cofounder **Janet Gunter**, the initial step to extend the lifespan of household appliances is to
  regularly clean and maintain them. By doing so, white goods, laptops, and mobile devices can last longer. Restart
  operates a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops and promotes a commercial repair directory in London. To find
  similar events in your area, visit repaircafe.org. Gunter stresses that if spare parts are not accessible, these
  appliances may be discarded, resulting in a significant carbon impact.<sup>2</sup>


- If your electrical appliance is truly irreparable, **Rhoads** recommends contacting the manufacturer or the company
  from
  which you made the purchase to inquire if they would take back the item or its packaging for reuse or recycling. While
  not all charity shops accept electrical items, the homelessness charity Emmaus welcomes working items that are tested
  before being resold, making it a great place to purchase secondhand electrical goods as well.<sup>2</sup>

### Create clean air

- **Oliver Heath**, who operates a sustainable architecture practice, claims that "you can never have enough
  houseplants."
  He suggests specific plants for particular rooms, stating that "mother-in-law's tongue is ideal for the bedroom since
  it emits oxygen at night." Meanwhile, **Chillingsworth** claims that peace lilies and Boston ferns flourish in
  high-humidity environments and can decrease the concentration of mould spores in the air, making them suitable for
  bathrooms. Weeping figs are the best option for removing formaldehyde released by furniture and carpets, making them a
  suitable choice for living areas.<sup>2</sup>

### Change your shower head

- According to Brian Horne from the ***Energy Saving Trust (EST)***, "investing in an aerated shower head can have a
  significant impact on water and energy consumption." These shower heads incorporate air into the water flow, thereby
  reducing water usage. Horne explains that "a water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 per
  year on gas for water heating, as well as an additional £115 on water bills if they use a meter."<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Opt for green energy suppliers

- According to **Horne**, there are different levels of environmental friendliness to consider when selecting an energy
  provider. Last year, the EST recognized four suppliers, including Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity, and
  Octopus Energy, who openly disclosed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites. Nevertheless, Horne
  cautions that even if you opt for a green energy plan, it does not mean that you can neglect energy conservation
  efforts.<sup>2</sup>

### Practise eco-driving

- The **RAC Foundation's** research indicates that eco-driving practices result in journeys that are safer, less
  polluting,
  and more economical. By upkeeping vehicles, fuel efficiency can improve by up to 10%. Prior to embarking on a long
  trip, it is recommended to verify that tire pressures are adequate (underinflated tires by a quarter can result in a
  2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unnecessary roof racks and boxes, and avoid overloading the car (as every
  additional 45kg decreases fuel economy by 2%). When driving at less than 40mph, it is more energy-efficient to open a
  window rather than using air conditioning. It is advised to switch off engines if they are idle for more than a
  minute (since 5-8% of fuel is consumed while idling), and avoid sudden acceleration and heavy braking as it can
  significantly increase fuel consumption.<sup>2</sup>

### Draught-proof your home

- According to **Dr Sarah Price**, who heads building physics at ***Enhabit***, a consultancy that specializes in
  low-energy
  design, draught-proofing windows, doors, letterboxes, fireplaces, and loft hatches is one of the most affordable and
  effective ways to save money and energy at home. It can be done professionally for approximately £200, or using
  products such as Gap Seal, as a DIY project.<sup>2</sup>

- Another easy way is to double-glaze your windows as non double-glazed windows can be the reason for a home to lose up
  to 30% of its heating or cooling.<sup>3</sup> You can also combine the windows with curtains with heavy liners, to
  close them when the sun sets not to lose any extra heat.

### Buy vintage furniture

- Founder of interior design studio Harding and Read, **Nicola Harding**, suggests that reusing furniture is not only
  the best
  thing to do, but it is also more enjoyable than buying new. Secondhand items come with interesting stories and prompt
  creative thinking, resulting in something unique. To minimize transportation distance, Harding suggests starting with
  local auction houses and charity shops, such as the ***British Heart Foundation***, which offers dedicated home stores
  and a
  free collection service. After that, a focused search can be conducted on platforms such as Freecycle and Facebook
  Marketplace.<sup>2</sup>

### Optimise your white goods

- **U Switch**, an independent energy comparison service, suggests that the cost of running your fridge and freezer
  makes up
  approximately 7% of your total energy bill, as they are among the few household devices that are constantly on. To
  save energy, **U Switch** recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over a decade old, even if it is
  still
  functioning. The cost of a new model will be offset by energy savings over time. Additionally, it is important to
  maintain your fridge's temperature at 5°C or below (most are kept at around 7°C, which causes food to spoil sooner),
  and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind it to allow heat to escape. Finally, check that the seal is strong, as if it
  cannot hold a piece of paper when closed, it may be allowing warm air to enter, forcing it to work harder.<sup>2</sup>

### Go smart

- Try having smart home gadgets,
  like [programmable thermostat](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/programmable-thermostats), leds or smart switches.
  This way you can control exactly when you use anything in your home and monitor how much do you use it.

### Insulate, Insulate, Insulate

- Your house isn't always that good at keeping in the heat. So try insulating around heat sources
  like [radiators](https://www.doityourself.com/stry/installing-reflective-insulation-behind-radiators), or places that
  are not usually insulating, like the attic.
- Chimney balloons are also another way of insulating your home, of course, if you have a chimney.
