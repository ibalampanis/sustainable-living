## What is Sustainable Living?

**Make the right decisions today, save the planet of tomorrow!**

The term Sustainable Living is used to express a lifestyle choice of reducing the carbon footprint and generally the use
of the Earth’s natural resources either as individuals or society.

The aim of Sustainable Living is to minimize as possible the harm inevitably caused to our planet by our own actions. In
our modern world of fast living and over consuming, we may not understand how important it is not only for us, but also
for the generations to come to protect and care after our environment. Climate change, rising sea levels, extreme
weather conditions and ozone layer thinning are all human induced problems that could result in our planet being doomed.

Despite the benefits of Sustainable Living to our environment, individuals that choose to live by that philosophy can
improve their well-being, both psychologically and physically. Generally, the quality of a person’s life is directly
affected by their habits and the way they choose to live. For example, Sustainable living can urge people to adopt
healthier habits and decrease their dependence on artificial machines by altering them in more eco-friendly options.

**In that way Sustainable Living makes you use less, want less, need less.**

## What is NOT Sustainable Living?

To be clear about sustainability lets define un-sustainability as well with an example, shall we? So lets imagine you
wake up an in world where 100000000 (finite number) apples are laying down in the ground, that don't go bad - for ever.
" Woooooooooooooow I have food forever" you think.
So you eat apples every day. But instead of eating one a day, you say:
" I have these many apples, why eat just one? Right people?"
And all your friends in your community agreed. So everyone started eating 10 apples a day (imaginary world okay?) and at
some point 100 and then 1000 and then 10000...
In the meantime, in your community people were having children that were getting used to having the privilege of eating
as many apples as they wanted.
However, as the number of apples is finite, the children got anxious and nervous at their parents for being so wasteful
and greedy with the apples, thinking they own them... So they started protesting but their parents didn't care. And they
kept eating and eating till 5 apples were left in the world. So no more apples for the children's generation.

## Getting started with sustainable & green living

Defining environmental sustainability in a clear and intelligible way, is of paramount importance, in order to approach
this topic properly.
Following a green lifestyle, means to shape a way of life oriented to some earth-friendly key directions, stated below.

- Redefine your needs and develop lighter habits
- Protect natural resources by avoiding their overconsumption and safeguarding biodiversity
- Be actively aware of the current threats posed to environment (i.e. climate crisis components) and get eco-conscious
- Become more adaptive and open to eco-friendly practices

## There are many things you can do to live a greener lifestyle. Here are some ideas to get you started:

### Reduce your energy consumption

One of the most effective ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to use less energy. You can do this by turning off
lights and electronics when you're not using them, using energy-efficient appliances, and sealing air leaks in your
home.

### Use sustainable transportation

Instead of driving everywhere, consider walking, biking, or taking public transportation. This will not only reduce your
carbon footprint but also improve your health.

### Reduce your water usage

You can conserve water by taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, and watering your lawn and garden only when
necessary.

### Reduce your waste

Recycling is a great way to reduce waste, but it's even better to reduce the amount of waste you produce in the first
place. Consider using reusable bags, containers, and water bottles, and composting your food scraps.

### Eat a plant-based diet

Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, so reducing your meat and dairy consumption
can have a big impact on the environment. Try incorporating more plant-based meals into your diet.

### Reduce your washing

- ***"Waste Not Every day" by Erin Rhoads***, published by **Hardie Grant Books** and priced at £10, the biggest impact
  on the
  environment caused by fashion occurs after we bring clothing home. In fact, 82% of the energy a garment consumes is a
  result of the washing and drying we do every week. **Rhoads** proposes alternatives to traditional washing, such as
  spot-cleaning and using diluted vodka or lemon juice to eliminate odors.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Clean with castile

- In "Clean Green" by **Jen Chillingsworth**, published by **Quadrille** and priced at £7.55, it is suggested that
  making your
  own cleaning products, such as polish and detergent, can decrease the amount of plastic entering your home and
  minimize the release of harmful VOCs, including formaldehyde. **Chillingsworth** highly recommends liquid castile
  soap,
  which was traditionally made with pure olive oil from Spain, but is now commonly produced by blending vegetable oils
  like hemp, avocado, jojoba, and coconut. For a straightforward and versatile kitchen spray, combine 50ml of castile
  soap with 800ml of tap water in a spray bottle, and add a few drops of essential oils, such as tea tree oil, which has
  antibacterial properties. Finally, spray the solution and wipe it down with a clean cloth.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>
</h1>

### Go for plastic-free personal care

- According to **Chillingsworth**, there are numerous options to explore when it comes to waste-free sanitary
  protection,
  and she recommends purchasing a reusable tampon applicator. This applicator is reusable, fits any size of tampon, and
  is antimicrobial and simple to insert. Once used, it can be wiped, rinsed, and returned to its storage box, which
  conveniently fits in a purse. It should be sterilized in hot water between periods for hygiene purposes.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Recycle as much as you can

- **Helen Bird**, a plastics expert at Wrap, a government waste advisory organization, states that many major
  supermarkets
  offer in-store collection points for stretchy plastics such as carrier bags, bread bags, and frozen food bags, which
  cannot typically be recycled at home.<sup>2</sup>


- **TerraCycle** is a company that specializes in rescuing waste that is difficult to recycle and is not handled by
  local
  councils. They offer national recycling programs free of charge, as well as sell zero-waste boxes that allow you to
  gather and return most non-organic, non-recyclable, and non-hazardous waste for recycling purposes. You can visit
  their website to locate a program in your area or establish your own.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Look after your electrical appliances

- The Restart Project is a social enterprise that strives to improve our relationship with electronics and electrical
  items. According to cofounder **Janet Gunter**, the initial step to extend the lifespan of household appliances is to
  regularly clean and maintain them. By doing so, white goods, laptops, and mobile devices can last longer. Restart
  operates a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops and promotes a commercial repair directory in London. To find
  similar events in your area, visit [repaircafe.org](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/). Gunter stresses that if spare
  parts are not accessible, these
  appliances may be discarded, resulting in a significant carbon impact.<sup>2</sup>


- If your electrical appliance is truly irreparable, **Rhoads** recommends contacting the manufacturer or the company
  from
  which you made the purchase to inquire if they would take back the item or its packaging for reuse or recycling. While
  not all charity shops accept electrical items, the homelessness charity Emmaus welcomes working items that are tested
  before being resold, making it a great place to purchase secondhand electrical goods as well.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Create clean air

- **Oliver Heath**, who operates a sustainable architecture practice, claims that "you can never have enough
  houseplants."
  He suggests specific plants for particular rooms, stating that "mother-in-law's tongue is ideal for the bedroom since
  it emits oxygen at night." Meanwhile, **Chillingsworth** claims that peace lilies and Boston ferns flourish in
  high-humidity environments and can decrease the concentration of mould spores in the air, making them suitable for
  bathrooms. Weeping figs are the best option for removing formaldehyde released by furniture and carpets, making them a
  suitable choice for living areas.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Change your shower head

- According to Brian Horne from the ***Energy Saving Trust (EST)***, "investing in an aerated shower head can have a
  significant impact on water and energy consumption." These shower heads incorporate air into the water flow, thereby
  reducing water usage. Horne explains that "a water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 per
  year on gas for water heating, as well as an additional £115 on water bills if they use a meter."<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Opt for green energy suppliers

- According to **Horne**, there are different levels of environmental friendliness to consider when selecting an energy
  provider. Last year, the EST recognized four suppliers, including Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity, and
  Octopus Energy, who openly disclosed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites. Nevertheless, Horne
  cautions that even if you opt for a green energy plan, it does not mean that you can neglect energy conservation
  efforts.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Practise eco-driving

- The **RAC Foundation's** research indicates that eco-driving practices result in journeys that are safer, less
  polluting,
  and more economical. By upkeeping vehicles, fuel efficiency can improve by up to 10%. Prior to embarking on a long
  trip, it is recommended to verify that tire pressures are adequate (underinflated tires by a quarter can result in a
  2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unnecessary roof racks and boxes, and avoid overloading the car (as every
  additional 45kg decreases fuel economy by 2%). When driving at less than 40mph, it is more energy-efficient to open a
  window rather than using air conditioning. It is advised to switch off engines if they are idle for more than a
  minute (since 5-8% of fuel is consumed while idling), and avoid sudden acceleration and heavy braking as it can
  significantly increase fuel consumption.<sup>2</sup>

### Draught-proof your home

- According to **Dr Sarah Price**, who heads building physics at ***Enhabit***, a consultancy that specializes in
  low-energy
  design, draught-proofing windows, doors, letterboxes, fireplaces, and loft hatches is one of the most affordable and
  effective ways to save money and energy at home. It can be done professionally for approximately £200, or using
  products such as Gap Seal, as a DIY project.<sup>2</sup>

- Another easy way is to double-glaze your windows as non double-glazed windows can be the reason for a home to lose up
  to 30% of its heating or cooling.<sup>3</sup> You can also combine the windows with curtains with heavy liners, to
  close them when the sun sets not to lose any extra heat.

</h1>

### Buy vintage furniture

- Founder of interior design studio Harding and Read, **Nicola Harding**, suggests that reusing furniture is not only
  the best
  thing to do, but it is also more enjoyable than buying new. Secondhand items come with interesting stories and prompt
  creative thinking, resulting in something unique. To minimize transportation distance, Harding suggests starting with
  local auction houses and charity shops, such as the ***British Heart Foundation***, which offers dedicated home stores
  and a
  free collection service. After that, a focused search can be conducted on platforms such as Freecycle and Facebook
  Marketplace.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Optimise your white goods

- **U Switch**, an independent energy comparison service, suggests that the cost of running your fridge and freezer
  makes up
  approximately 7% of your total energy bill, as they are among the few household devices that are constantly on. To
  save energy, **U Switch** recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over a decade old, even if it is
  still
  functioning. The cost of a new model will be offset by energy savings over time. Additionally, it is important to
  maintain your fridge's temperature at 5°C or below (most are kept at around 7°C, which causes food to spoil sooner),
  and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind it to allow heat to escape. Finally, check that the seal is strong, as if it
  cannot hold a piece of paper when closed, it may be allowing warm air to enter, forcing it to work harder.<sup>2</sup>

</h4>

</h1>

### Go smart

- Try having smart home gadgets,
  like [programmable thermostat](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/programmable-thermostats), leds or smart switches.
  This way you can control exactly when you use anything in your home and monitor how much do you use it.

</h4>

### Insulate, Insulate, Insulate

- Your house isn't always that good at keeping in the heat. So try insulating around heat sources
  like [radiators](https://www.doityourself.com/stry/installing-reflective-insulation-behind-radiators), or places that
  are not usually insulating, like the attic.
- Chimney balloons are also another way of insulating your home, of course, if you have a chimney.

### Use your own cup

- According to
  the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/26/why-britains-25-billion-paper-coffee-cups-are-an-eco-disaster),
  in the UK alone 2.5 billion paper cups were used, most of which were used only once. On average, a paper cup requires
  0.58 liters of water to be produced, and leaves a carbon footprint of 60.9 grams of carbon dioxide. By using your cup
  when buying a coffee, you can reduce the amount of waste produced by single-use cups, protect the environment and even
  spend less money long-term.

</h4>

</h1>

### Invest in renewable energy solutions

- Investing in renewable energy solutions, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can have a significant impact on
  reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

- Renewable energy is becoming increasingly accessible and affordable, and many governments offer incentives and tax
  credits for homeowners and businesses to invest in these technologies.

- By generating your own renewable energy, you can reduce your reliance on fossil fuels, save money on energy bills, and
  even generate income by selling surplus energy back to the grid.

### Use LED Lights

- Sam Allcock, in his
  article [Sustainable Living: 5 Ways To Do Your Part for The Planet](https://wealthofgeeks.com/sustainable-living-5-ways-to-do-your-part-for-the-planet/)
  states that a good way to reduce your energy use and carbon footprint is replacing traditional bulbs with Light
  Emitting Diodes (LED) lights.

- LED lights have an exceptionally longer life span, while also consuming less energy. Also, unlike traditional bulbs,
  LED lights do not contain harmful materials and gasses, such as mercury. That way, you can save money of your
  electrical bill while also protecting yourself and the environment.

### Recycle And Recharge Batteries

- Don't throw away used batteries in regular trash or choose rechargeable batteries. Most types of regular batteries
  contain materials and components very harmful both for people and the environment. They can be the cause to fires, or
  even explosions, and the pollution of soil.

- Here are some ways to recycle or safely discard conventional batteries, as stated by
  the [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/recycle/used-household-batteries):
    1. To prevent fires from lithium-ion batteries, tape battery terminals and/or place batteries in separate plastic
       bags and never put these batteries in household garbage or recycling bins.
    2. Choose the right recycling spot closer to you. [Earth911]( https://search.earth911.com/?what=Batteries) is a
       useful site for finding the right disposal spot.
    3. Send your used batteries in mail-in recycle programs, such as [Call2Recycle](https://www.call2recycle.org/).

### Practice mindful consumption by only buying what you need and repairing instead of replacing broken items.
It involves considering the environmental impact, social implications, and personal needs before making a purchase.

One business that encourages this movement is "Patagonia" which is a well-known outdoor apparel brand that is committed to reducing its environmental impact and promoting fair labor practises.

We can adopt this mentality from books such as "The life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" and "Cradle to Cradle".

By being intentional about the things we buy and consume, we can reduce our environmental impact and promote social justice.
