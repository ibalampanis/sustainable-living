# Quiz about Sustainability

This quiz is designed to test your knowledge on sustainability, the practice of balancing economic, social, and environmental factors 
to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
The quiz consists of 5 multiple-choice questions and after that you will be able to see your score at the end.
It can also be used as an educational tool to promote sustainability awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors.
